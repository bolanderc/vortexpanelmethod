# vortexpanelmethod

This package implements a simple vortex panel method for calculating the
inviscid flow solution and resulting aerodynamic performance of arbitrary
airfoils. 

## Example

```python
import vortexpanelmethod


# generate geometry

# generate and run case for a given angle of attack

# show results

```

## Notes


## Documentation

See doc strings in code. 

## Installation

Run either of the following commands in the main directory.

'pip install .'
or
'python setup.py install'

If developing, instead use

'pip install -e .'
or
'python setup.py develop'

It is recommended that pip is used instead of invoking setup.py directly.

### Prerequisites

* Numpy

### Getting the Source Code

The source code can be found at [https://github.com/bolanderc/vortexpanelmethod.git](https://github.com/bolanderc/vortexpanelmethod.git)

You can either download the source as a ZIP file and extract the contents, or 
clone the panairwrapper repository using Git. If your system does not already have a 
version of Git installed, you will not be able to use this second option unless 
you first download and install Git. If you are unsure, you can check by typing 
`git --version` into a command prompt.

#### Downloading source as a ZIP file

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://github.com/bolanderc/vortexpanelmethod.git](https://github.com/bolanderc/vortexpanelmethod.git)
2. Make sure the Branch is set to `Master`
3. Click the `Clone or download` button
4. Select `Download ZIP`
5. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a local directory on your machine

#### Cloning the Github repository

1. From the command prompt navigate to the directory where vortexpanelmethod will be installed
2. `git clone https://github.com/bolanderc/vortexpanelmethod.git`

## Testing
Unit tests are implemented using the pytest module and are run using the following command.

'python3 -m pytest test/'
